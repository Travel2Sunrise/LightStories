We collect and process personal data only insofar as this is necessary for providing a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of personal data is carried out regularly only with your consent or when processing is permitted by law.

## 3. Hosting

This website is hosted by **Vercel Inc.**, 340 S Lemon Ave #4133, Walnut, CA 91789, USA.

When you visit our website, Vercel automatically collects information in server log files. This information includes:

Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in the secure and efficient provision of the website). Vercel is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which ensures an adequate level of data protection for data transfers to the USA.

## 4. SSL/TLS Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, this website uses SSL/TLS encryption. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of your browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock icon in your browser bar.

## 5. Contact Form

When you send us inquiries via the contact form, the following data is collected:

- Name
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)

This data is processed exclusively for the purpose of handling your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (pre-contractual measures) or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in responding to inquiries).

The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion or the purpose for data storage no longer applies. Mandatory statutory provisions — in particular retention periods — remain unaffected.

## 6. Email Delivery via Resend

We use the service **Resend** (Resend Inc., USA) for sending contact form emails. The data you enter in the contact form is transmitted to Resend to deliver the email.

Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in reliable email delivery). Data transfer to the USA is based on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) pursuant to Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR.

Technically necessary cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing technically necessary cookies to provide its services in a technically error-free manner.

## 8. Links to Social Networks

Our website contains links to social networks (Instagram, Facebook). These are simple hyperlinks — no social media plugins or tracking scripts are embedded.
