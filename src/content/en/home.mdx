    For me, photography is about more than just beautiful photos. It's about real moments. About laughter, closeness, quiet glances – and all the little details that often tell more than perfectly staged poses.

    I'm a calm, humorous, and creative person – and that's exactly how my shoots are too. With me, you can arrive, take a breath, and simply be yourself. You don't need any experience in front of the camera, no "model proportions," and certainly no perfect pose. My job is to put you in the right light and make you feel comfortable. We'll do the rest together.

    Many people say they're "not photogenic." I love proving exactly those people wrong. Because every person is beautiful – in their own unique way.

    My photos should still feel like you, even years later. Honest, natural, and full of emotion.
