metaDescription: "Answers to the most common questions about your photo shoot – from camera nervousness to choosing the right outfit."
faq:
  - question: "What if I feel uncomfortable in front of the camera?"
    answer: >
      That's completely normal – most people feel the same way. You don't have to pretend or
      'perform'. I take my time, create a calm atmosphere, and guide you step by step. Often the
      nervousness disappears within the first few minutes.
  - question: "I'm not photogenic – is a shoot even worth it?"
    answer: >
      Many of my clients say that – and are later surprised by their photos. Being photogenic has
      nothing to do with model proportions. It's about light, perspective, trust, and real moments.
      And that's exactly what I'm here for.
  - question: "I have no experience in front of a camera. Is that a problem?"
    answer: >
      Not at all. You don't need any posing experience. I'll give you small, natural directions –
      no stiff poses, just movements and moments that feel right.
  - question: "What should I wear?"
    answer: >
      You'll get tips from me beforehand so you feel comfortable and your style matches the
      photos. Most importantly: you should feel like yourself in your clothes – not dressed up.
  - question: "What if I'm nervous or feel awkward at the beginning?"
    answer: >
      That's totally normal too. We start relaxed, with no pressure. Often the most beautiful
      photos happen exactly when you stop thinking about the camera – and that's where I'll
      guide you.
  - question: "I don't like staged poses – do I have to pose?"
    answer: >
      No. I work with natural movements and real moments. You can laugh, move around, or be
      still for a moment – everything is welcome. That's exactly how authentic photos are created.
