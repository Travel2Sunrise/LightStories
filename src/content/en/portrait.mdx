title: "Portrait Photography"
description: |
  A portrait is more than a beautiful picture. It's a feeling. A moment where you might see yourself in a completely new way.

  You don't have to be a model – quite the opposite. I'll guide you calmly through the shoot, give you small prompts, and make sure you feel confident in front of the camera. Together we'll find your expression, your angle, your light.

  Many people discover for the first time how beautiful they can look in photos. And that's exactly my goal: honest portraits that don't look polished, but show you as you are.
