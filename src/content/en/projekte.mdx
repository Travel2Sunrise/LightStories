      Just reach out to me – with your idea, your occasion, or simply the wish for beautiful
      photos. Together we'll discuss what you have in mind and what suits you. There's no
      'right' or 'wrong' – only what feels right for you.
  - title: "Preparation without stress"

      I'll give you tips on clothing, colors, and the schedule. Nothing complicated – just
      small helps so you feel confident and know what to expect. You can just be yourself,
      because that's exactly what makes the photos authentic.
  - title: "The shoot – relaxed, calm & no pressure"
    text: >
      During the shoot, you don't need any skills. I'll gently guide you, give you small
      prompts, and create a relaxed atmosphere. Laughter is welcome, breaks are perfectly
      fine – we take all the time we need.
  - title: "Selection & editing"
    text: >
      After the shoot, I'll select the most beautiful moments for you and edit them in my
      natural style. You'll get images that feel like you – not over the top, but honest
      and timeless.
  - title: "Your memories for eternity"
    text: >
      In the end, you won't just be holding photos – you'll be holding memories. Moments
      that last. Feelings you can experience again and again.
