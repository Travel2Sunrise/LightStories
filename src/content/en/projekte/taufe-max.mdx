excerpt: "A baptism is a very special moment – quiet, emotional, and full of meaning.
It's the glances of the family, the small gestures, the closeness between parents, godparents, and child.

I capture these moments discreetly and respectfully, without disrupting the ceremony. The result is natural photos that reflect the atmosphere of this special day – full of warmth, love, and togetherness.

Memories that last. For you – and for your child, when they look back someday."
